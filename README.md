#Object Detection Comparision between YOLOv3 
This project compares two object detection models—YOLOv3 and Faster R-CNN—on the PSU Car Dataset containing aerial images. The goal is to evaluate accuracy, speed, and robustness in detecting cars under challenging visual conditions.

##Motivation
Detecting vehicles from aerial images is crucial for smart cities, surveillance, and traffic analysis. However, detecting small, occluded, or densely packed cars remains difficult. We explore which architecture offers better trade-offs between performance and speed.
We used the PSU Car Dataset, consisting of 218 training images (3,364 annotated cars) and 52 test
images (738 annotated cars). The dataset features aerial imagery with challenges including small object
sizes, occlusion, and scale variations
